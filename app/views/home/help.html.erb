				<p align="justify">Employer accounts are capable of viewing the total amount of salaries earned by each employees by looking at the attendance page. They may also edit the information about the employee's attendance, for instance, if the employee forgot to timeout the previous day, and employers can also edit employee's profile information. Employers are also allowed to create new user accounts which will accomodate employees for timing in and out, create cutoff dates, set the current date either as a working holiday or regular working day and print the list of attendance for each cutoffs. Overtime authorizations to any other employees can also be authorized by the employer, and whether to allow or prevent an admin account to activate holiday pay and also authorize overtime to other employees.</p>

				<p align="justify">Administrator accounts are for those employees who are entrusted by their employers to manage the payroll system of the company. As trusted individuals, administrators can also do almost everything what employers can do. The only difference is that administrators cannot view the total amount of salaries earned by employees in the attendance page. They are not authorized to create another employer's account, but they are still allowed to create another administrator or employee accounts. Lastly, if the administrator is authorized by the employer, they may also set the current date as a working holiday and authorize overtime for other employees.</p>

				<p align="justify">For using an employee account, you do not have authority to edit information in the attendance or profile information. You will have to ask your employer or system administrator to edit the information you want. If you are allowed by the employer / system administrator, they will use their account and go to the editing page. From there, you can edit the information and you'll have to type your password to confirm the changes in your profile data. As for attendance information editing, no password confirmations are required.</p>
