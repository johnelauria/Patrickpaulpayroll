<h1>About the system</h1>
<br />
<p align="justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This generic type of payroll system is designed for large businesses / organizations that consist many employees, however, smaller companies may also use this system for precise calculations of wages and tax deductibles based on each employee's information. Attendance is being monitored by this system, which includes total time rendered, date, and employee's name are all saved in the database. The salaries of each employee are  automatically calculated by the system based on the time spent by an employee working in the office. The system will be precise in its calculation that every minute spent working will have its equivalent salary value and it will be counted in the calculation for the employee's salary. Monthly deductibles, such as SSS, Philhealth, Pagibig and Withholding tax can be included in the net income of each salary during cutoff. By going in the "Cutoff" page, the total salary of each employees are counted, clicking on the "Include deductibles" button will include the monthly deductibles of each salary and computing for the total net income of each employees. Working holidays are considered as double pay, meaning that the normal salary of each employee will be doubled when working on holidays. Employers / System administrators should manually trigger the day as a Holiday in the Attendance Page. </p>
<br />
<p align="justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There will be 3 types of users in this system. Each types of users will have different levels of authorities according to their type. <strong>Employer</strong> accounts are capable of viewing the total amount of salaries earned by each employees by looking at the attendance page. They may also edit the information about the employee's attendance, for instance, if the employee forgot to timeout the previous day, and employers can also edit employee's profile information. Employers are also allowed to create new user accounts which will accomodate employees for timing in and out, create cutoff dates, set the current date either as a working holiday or regular working day and print the list of attendance for each cutoffs. <strong>Administrator</strong> accounts are for those employees who are entrusted by their employers to manage the payroll system of the company. As trusted individuals, administrators can also do almost everything what employers can do. The only difference is that administrators cannot view the total amount of salaries earned by employees in the attendance page. They are not authorized to create another employer's account, but they are still allowed to create another administrator or employee accounts. Lastly, if the administrator is authorized by the employer, they may also set the current date as a working holiday and authorize overtime for other employees. <strong>Employee</strong> accounts are the basic accounts in the system. Employee accounts may only time in and time out for their attendance. They may also see their own record of attendance in their profile which consists the total hours rendered and salaries earned for each day. All employees will be notified about their tardiness. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once this system has been installed in one server computer, the system can already be accessed in all the computers within the Local Area Network(LAN). In order to have access to this system in the network, the server computer server must be running the <a href="#railsserver" data-toggle="modal">rails server</a> in the server computer. If the server is already running, the system can be accessed in all other computers within the network by entering (IP address:3000) example would be (http://192.168.1.1:3000) in the browser. An alternative option would be to type the hostname of the computer server then the port number 3000 (example: http://server-computer:3000). This system has been tested in different browsers and is known to be working in Internet Explorer 8 or higher version, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and Safari</p>

		<p>The rails server shortcut should already be placed in the desktop by your programmer. If not, you may require assistance from your programmer or an IT who knows about command prompt.</p><br />
		<p>Assuming that you know about command prompt, change your current directory to the "Payroll" folder (ex. "cd c:\yourpath\payroll"). Once you've gone there, type in "rails server" in the command line to launch WEBrick rails server. Wait a couple of seconds and the system will be running on your http://localhost:3000 in your local browser. It is advisable that you create a batch file in your desktop for running your server</p>
